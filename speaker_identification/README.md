# Intro to speaker Identification

For these test I will be using **libri speech** dataset, specifically librispeech-train-clean-100. The contents are as follows:
  * **Total hours of audio** - 100.6 H
  * **Total Speakers** - 251
  * **Female Speakers** - 125
  * **Male Speakers** - 126
  * **Average Minutes of audio per speaker** - 25 minutes
This offers a diverse balanced dataset with plenty of samples for this task. link here -> http://www.openslr.org/12

First I will be repeating the setup from the music genre classification, only instead of using the entirety of each audio clip, I will only be using 5 seconds of each. This is because this dataset offers much more data, and this will speed up the process a bit.
